##Nested Resources Demo

A demo of nesting that follows these guidelines:

1.  *Resources should never nested more than 1 level deep* - Jamis Buck
2. Common, public, or externally sourced information should have a separate sub-directory such as '/info/'.  This is a personal preference.

To demo this the following object hierarchy will be used:

- User > Notepad > Note
- Country > State > City (Common Information)
